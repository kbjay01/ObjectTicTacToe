# ObjectTicTacToe
TicTacToe game, as a project that I was learning from. I've already built such a game, but I wasn't using OOP techniques. It was actually a homework from C++ course that I was learning from. I modified non OOP code to OOP app, and yeah it finally works.

Project is done. After testing everything seems to be working. This project took me way too long to make, but I think that I learned many things from it. One day I just decided that I want to finish this project, and make this app work. And here it is

Enjoy :D
